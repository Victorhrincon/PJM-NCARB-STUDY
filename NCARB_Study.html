    {
      q: "A firm is awarded a project for a new public library. The site has significant elevation changes and potential drainage issues. Which consultant should the architect recommend the owner hire first?", 
      a: "Civil Engineer", 
      ex: "Civil engineers are responsible for site-related issues like grading, drainage, and utility connections. Because this is a greenfield site with drainage concerns, their input is critical early on."
    },
    {
      q: "A Project Manager is reviewing the firm's health. The total billable hours for the month were 1,400, while the total hours worked by all staff were 2,000. What is the Utilization Rate?", 
      a: "70%", 
      ex: "Utilization Rate = (Direct/Billable Labor Hours ÷ Total Labor Hours) x 100. In this case: 1,400 / 2,000 = 0.70 or 70%."
    },
    {
      q: "An architect is assembling a team for a high-rise residential building. The owner has expressed concern about the local soil's bearing capacity. Which consultant is required to identify below-grade conditions?", 
      a: "Geotechnical Engineer", 
      ex: "As seen in your example, Geotechnical engineers identify necessary below-grade conditions (soil, rock, water table) to inform the structural design of the foundation."
    },
    {
      q: "During a project, the Principal Architect notices that the 'Project Labor Client' is consistently higher than the 'Earned Value.' What does this typically indicate?", 
      a: "The project is over budget on labor.", 
      ex: "If the actual labor cost (Project Labor) exceeds the value of the work completed to date (Earned Value), the project is spending more resources than planned for that stage."
    },
    {
      q: "A small firm is taking on its first large-scale hospital project. Which staffing strategy should the PM use to ensure quality without exceeding the fee?", 
      a: "Balanced/Matrix Staffing (Mix of senior and junior staff)", 
      ex: "Resource management requires balancing high-cost experts for oversight and lower-cost junior staff for production to keep the average hourly rate within the project's 'Break-even' limit."
    }
  ],
  2: [
    {
      q: "A Project Manager is creating a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). What is the primary purpose of this tool?", 
      a: "To divide the project into manageable work packages for scheduling and fee allocation.", 
      ex: "A WBS organizes the total scope of the project into smaller, more trackable parts."
    },
    {
      q: "Which scheduling method is best for identifying the sequence of tasks that determines the shortest possible project duration?", 
      a: "Critical Path Method (CPM)", 
      ex: "CPM identifies the 'Critical Path'—the sequence of dependent tasks that, if delayed, will delay the entire project completion."
    },
    {
      q: "During the design phase, the client adds a new requirement that will take 3 weeks to design. The PM determines this task is NOT on the critical path. What does this mean for the final deadline?", 
      a: "The final deadline will not change.", 
      ex: "Tasks not on the critical path have 'float' or 'slack' time, meaning they can be delayed or extended without affecting the project's end date."
    },
    {
      q: "A firm uses a 'Top-Down' budgeting approach for a new project. How is the labor budget determined?", 
      a: "By starting with the total fee and subtracting non-labor costs and profits to see what's left for hours.", 
      ex: "Top-Down starts with the 'big number' (the fee) and works backward, whereas Bottom-Up starts by estimating individual task hours."
    },
    {
      q: "What is a 'Milestone' in a project schedule?", 
      a: "A significant point or event in a project that has zero duration.", 
      ex: "Milestones mark completion of phases or major deliverables (e.g., '100% CD Submittal') rather than the work leading up to them."
    }
  ],
  3: [
    {
      q: "According to AIA B101, which of the following is considered an 'Additional Service' rather than a 'Basic Service'?", 
      a: "Fast-track design services, interior design, or LEED certification.", 
      ex: "Basic Services include Structural, MEP, and Civil engineering. Anything else usually requires extra compensation."
    },
    {
      q: "Under AIA A201, if the Architect finds a non-conforming condition during a site visit, who has the authority to reject the work?", 
      a: "The Architect.", 
      ex: "The Architect has the authority to reject work that does not conform to the Contract Documents."
    },
    {
      q: "What is 'Indemnification' in an architectural contract?", 
      a: "A clause where one party agrees to hold the other harmless from loss or damage.", 
      ex: "This is a key risk management tool used to protect against legal claims."
    },
    {
      q: "If an Owner terminates the B101 agreement for convenience, what is the Architect entitled to?", 
      a: "Payment for work performed and a termination fee.", 
      ex: "The Architect must be paid for services up to the date of termination, plus costs incurred due to the termination."
    },
    {
      q: "Who owns the Copyright to the 'Instruments of Service' (the drawings and specs)?", 
      a: "The Architect.", 
      ex: "Even after the project is done, the Architect retains ownership and the Owner is granted a license to use them."
    }
  ],  4: [
    {
      q: "The Contractor submits a 'Submittal' for a custom window system. What is the Architect's primary responsibility when reviewing it?", 
      a: "To check for conformance with the design concept and the contract documents.", 
      ex: "The Architect does NOT approve 'means and methods' or dimensions; they only verify it meets the design intent."
    },
    {
      q: "During a site visit, the Architect notices the Contractor is using a different rebar spacing than specified. What should the Architect do first?", 
      a: "Inform the Contractor and the Owner in a Field Report.", 
      ex: "The Architect must document the non-conforming work. Note: Only the Owner has the legal right to 'order' work to stop, but the Architect can 'reject' work."
    },
    {
      q: "What is the purpose of an RFI (Request for Information) during the Execution phase?", 
      a: "To clarify the contract documents when the Contractor finds a gap or conflict.", 
      ex: "The Architect should respond to RFIs promptly to prevent project delays."
    },
    {
      q: "Which AIA document is used as the 'Application and Certificate for Payment'?", 
      a: "AIA G702", 
      ex: "The Architect signs this to certify to the Owner that the work has progressed to the point indicated by the Contractor."
    },
    {
      q: "What is 'Substantial Completion'?", 
      a: "The stage where the project is sufficiently complete so the Owner can occupy it for its intended use.", 
      ex: "This date is critical because it starts the statute of limitations and the warranty period."
    }
  ],  5: [
    {
      q: "What is a 'Peer Review' in an architectural firm?", 
      a: "An internal review of project documents by a senior staff member not involved in the project.", 
      ex: "This provides a fresh set of eyes to catch errors and omissions before the drawings are issued."
    },
    {
      q: "A firm uses a 'Project Checklist' for every phase of design. This is an example of what type of management?", 
      a: "Quality Assurance (QA)", 
      ex: "Quality Assurance is the process-oriented approach (the 'how'), while Quality Control (QC) is the product-oriented approach (checking the 'what' at the end)."
    },
    {
      q: "How does 'BIM' (Building Information Modeling) assist in Quality Control during the design phase?", 
      a: "Automated clash detection.", 
      ex: "BIM software can identify physical overlaps between structural beams and MEP ducts, preventing costly field changes."
    },
    {
      q: "What is the primary goal of 'Total Quality Management' (TQM) within a firm?", 
      a: "Continuous improvement of all firm processes based on staff and client feedback.", 
      ex: "TQM involves every member of the firm, from interns to principals, to reduce errors and improve client satisfaction."
    },
    {
      q: "During the CD phase, the PM performs a 'Code Review.' Why is this considered Quality Control?", 
      a: "To ensure the design complies with life-safety and accessibility regulations before bidding.", 
      ex: "Correcting code issues during design is significantly cheaper and safer than fixing them during construction."
    }
  ],
  6: [
    {
      q: "The Architect is coordinating with a MEP consultant. Who is responsible for ensuring the ductwork does not interfere with the structural steel?", 
      a: "The Architect (as the Prime Consultant).", 
      ex: "While the MEP engineer designs the ducts, the Architect is responsible for the overall coordination of all consultants' work."
    },
    {
      q: "What is the most effective way for a PM to ensure all team members are aware of project changes and deadlines?", 
      a: "Regularly scheduled project meetings with distributed minutes.", 
      ex: "Documentation is key in PjM; meeting minutes serve as the official record of decisions and responsibilities."
    },
    {
      q: "A consultant's work is consistently late, threatening the project schedule. What is the PM's first course of action?", 
      a: "Review the Consultant Agreement and discuss the schedule requirements with them.", 
      ex: "The Architect-Consultant agreement (AIA C401) defines the consultant's obligation to perform in a timely manner."
    },
    {
      q: "When a Consultant provides a drawing to the Architect, what should the Architect do before incorporating it into the set?", 
      a: "Perform a coordination check (Clash Detection).",

    },
    {
      q: "What is the difference between a 'Change Order' and a 'Construction Change Directive' (CCD)?", 
      a: "A Change Order is agreed upon by all three parties; a CCD is ordered by the Owner/Architect without the Contractor's prior agreement on cost.", 
      ex: "A CCD is used to keep the project moving when the Contractor and Owner cannot agree on the price for a change."
    },
    {
      q: "What is a 'Waiver of Subrogation'?", 
      a: "A clause where parties agree not to sue each other for losses covered by insurance.", 
      ex: "This prevents insurance companies from trying to recover money from the other project participants, reducing legal conflict."
